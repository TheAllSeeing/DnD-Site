        <h1>About Me: Atai Ambus</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Atai Ambus. I was born on the seventeenth of November. I like stories, philosophy and
            <span style="font-size:18pt"><a href="About the Subject.html">Dungeons and Dragons</a></span>, or "D&D" - The most amazing game of all times (You can press the link for more details).
            <br />
            <br />
            I live in Kadima Tzoran, learn in Oded High-School, and expand in Physics and, well,
            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14.5pt">You</span> guessed it, programming.
            <br />
            <br />
            As mentioned above, I love stories, and as part of that, I also love creating them. In fact, for the past year and a half, I have been building worlds (and stories within them) with one of my friends. There are gods, magic, empires, mythical creatures, powerful artifacts, and a few twists, that I think actually do differentiate it from generic high fantasy. we are currently still developing it, and it's going to be awesome.
            <br />
            <br />
            I also love cryptograms and languages and invented and memorized a bunch of letters, which I now use constantly use as a phonetic cipher, to make sure people can't read the thoughts I scribble in my notebook.
            <br />
            It is actually a dream of mine to make it into a full language, grammar and lexicon and all, but I want to learn a little more linguistics first, to make sure it is really as rich and realistic as I want it to be.

            But, well, I think I spilled enough about myself. Make sure to press the links below, and I'll see you later!
